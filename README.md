# Robot Control in a 3D environment
## Overview
![alt text](https://github.com/zaid-gul/3D-Robot-Control-in-ROS/blob/master/3D%20Simulator.jpg?raw=true)
**Robot exhibits the following behaviour based on the user's input:** 
1. Move randomly in the environment and reach the random coordinates.
2. Directly asks the user for the target coordinates and reaches it.
3. Start following the external walls.
4. Stop in the last position.

## Contents of the Package
- **random_server.cpp:** Node used for generating random coordinates out of the 6 coordinates, [(-4,-3);(-4,2);(-4,7);(5,-7);(5,-3);(5,1)]
- **user_interface.cpp:** Node used for getting input from user to control the robot in different modes
- **target.srv:** Custom service file for x and y coordinates
- **wall_follow_service_m.py:** This service file makes the robot follow the walls
- **simulation_gmapping.launch:** Launch file for executing the simulator 
- **move_base.launch:** Launch file for executing move_base
- **user_interface.launch:** Launch file for executing the main user interface

## How to run the code
First go the ROS workspace and type this command:
```
catkin_make
```
Launch the simulator using the following command:
```
roslaunch final_assignment simulation_gmapping.launch
```
Next, type the following command to move_base:
```
roslaunch final_assignment move_base.launch
```
Finally, type the following command to execute the User Interface:
```
roslaunch final_assignment user_interface.launch
```
## Systemâ€™s limitations and possible improvements
When the user selects option # 1 or 2, the robot moves towards the target coordinates. For example, the user is unable to provide new coordinates to the robot until it has reached the target position. There should be a command to stop the robot and then provide new target coordinates. When the user selects option # 3, the robot continues to follow the walls and it cannot be stopped. There should be a condition that continuously checks if a specific key is pressed or not in order to stop the robot and return to the main user interface. 

## Requirements
- Ubuntu (Linux) or Docker Image https://hub.docker.com/r/carms84/rpr
